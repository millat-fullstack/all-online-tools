      Portable Document Format (PDF) is one of the most widely used file types for documents, reports, 
      and presentations. However, there are times when you may need to convert a PDF into an image 
      format such as JPG. For example, students may need an image version of lecture notes for easy 
      sharing, professionals may want to insert a PDF page into a presentation, or designers may 
      need a high-resolution image for editing. 
    </p>

      While many converters exist, not all maintain the original quality of your PDF. 
      Some reduce resolution, distort text, or create oversized files.

      clear results with minimal effort. Best of all, it‚Äôs completely free and doesn‚Äôt require
